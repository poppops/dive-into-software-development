# Functions Loops and Iterators Challenge

Complete as many of the following challenges as you can to demonstrate an understanding of loops and iterators.

1. The Fizz Buzz Challenge

Create a function that accepts a positive number as it's only argument.

The function should run a loop from 1 to the number provided and output the value to the console.

As the loop runs, if the current number is a multiple of 3, write "Fizz" instead of that number.

If the number is a multiple of 5, write "Buzz" instead.

If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, write "FizzBuzz" instead.

For example, if the number 15 was provided, the output should be as follows;

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
``````

2. Loop through the following array to complete the sentence below;

```
const words = {
    adjective1: "quick",
    adjective2: "brown",
    noun1: "fox",
    verb1: "jumped",
    adjective3: "lazy",
    noun2: "dog"
}

let sentence = "The adjective1 adjective2 noun1 verb1 over the adjective3 noun2."

```

3. Write a loop to create the following data structure

```
let timesTable = {
    1: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12],
    2: [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24],
    3: [3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36]
}
```
